    		<p id="paragraph"> I am a big sports lover and I really like to travel. Exploring the world is my life goal and I also appreciate taking pictures. I want to work in business and create a web page about my travels, like a travel blog. I could share my experiences and people could be inspired. As a ski instructor I have many new destination ideas that I would love to discover. I think coding is really interesting and can allow you to create a lot of cool stuff ! </p>

    		<img src="images/trips.jpeg" class="illustrations-sizing">
    		<p>I used to travel a lot with my family during the holidays. I began to go on several trips with my friends afterwards and even alone sometimes. I really appreciate travelling ! It can teach you a lot of different things about foreign cultures and makes you become more independent ! ðŸ˜Ž</p>

    		<h2>Languages</h2>

    		<p>I speak multiple languages fluently as I have an international background. Languages are really important while travelling, it is the main way of communicating with people and creating connexions ! </p>

    		<p>Skiing is my passion since I was 3 years old. I love the adrenaline it gives you while shredding hard slopes and I find comfort in the mountains. Thus, I decided to become a ski instructor and am now sharing this amazing sport with people who come from all around the world :)</p>

		    <p>One of my favorite hobbies besides sport, photography and discovering new places is drawing. I love to draw in my spare time, especially using watercolours. I began by sketching and drawing little things. Now, I'm learning even more and am starting to paint landscapes and create more detailed drawings.</p>
